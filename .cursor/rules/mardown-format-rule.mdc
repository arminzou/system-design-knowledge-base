# Material for MkDocs: Admonition Formatting Guide

## Basic Syntax

```
!!! type "Optional Title"

    Content of the admonition (indented by 4 spaces)

**IMPORTANT:** Note the empty line after the title line before the content. This line break is required.

## Collapsible Admonitions

```
??? type "Optional Title"

    Content of the collapsible admonition (indented by 4 spaces)
```

Expanded by default:

```
???+ type "Optional Title"

    Content of the expanded collapsible admonition (indented by 4 spaces)
```

    -   This is first item
    -   This is second item
```

### Note with Custom Title
```

    This is a note with a custom title.
```

## Nested Admonitions

```

    !!! tip "Inner Tip"

        This is a nested tip inside the note.
```

## Inline Admonitions

Right-aligned:
```
!!! info inline end "Right-aligned"

    This admonition is aligned to the right.
```

Left-aligned:
```
!!! info inline "Left-aligned"

    This admonition is aligned to the left.
```

## Tips

1.  Content must be indented by 4 spaces
2.  Added an empty line after each admonition declaration is **REQUIRED** - this is the most common formatting mistake
3.  For collapsible blocks, use `???` instead of `!!!`
4.  For expanded collapsible blocks, use `???+`
5.  Inline blocks must be placed before content they should appear next to
6.  All content after the empty line must be indented with 4 spaces to be part of the admonition
