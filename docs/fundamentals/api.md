# API Development & Management

## Application Protocols

### HTTP/HTTPS

Protocols for transmitting web content; HTTPS adds encryption for secure data transfer.

!!! info "Key Concepts"

    - **Request/Response Model**
    - **Headers and Body**
    - **Status Codes** (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)
    - **CORS and Security**
    - **Caching Mechanisms**

!!! example "Common Methods"

    - **GET**: Retrieve data
    - **POST**: Submit data
    - **PUT**: Update existing resources
    - **DELETE**: Remove resources

#### HTTP Versions

Evolution and key improvements:

!!! info "Version Features"

    - **HTTP/1.1**: Basic persistent connections
    - **HTTP/2**: Multiplexing, Server Push
    - **HTTP/3**: QUIC protocol, improved performance

### WebSockets

Communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

!!! tip "When to Use"

    - Ideal for real-time applications like chat, live notifications, and collaborative tools


## API Architecture

API Architecture defines the overall design approach for building and exposing APIs. Different architectural styles offer various tradeoffs in terms of complexity, performance, and flexibility.

### REST (Representational State Transfer)

Architectural style for designing networked applications using HTTP methods and
stateless operations.

!!! info "Key Principles"

    - Stateless
    - Resource-based
    - Uses standard HTTP methods
    - Representation-oriented

!!! info "When to Use"

    - Public APIs with diverse clients
    - Mobile applications
    - Web applications
    - When HTTP caching is beneficial
    - For systems requiring simple, standards-based integration

### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

A protocol specification for exchanging structured information in web services using XML. It defines a standardized format for messages and a set of rules for communication between applications.

!!! info "Characteristics"

    - XML-based messaging format
    - Platform and language independent
    - Strong typing and validation
    - Supports multiple transport protocols (HTTP, SMTP, TCP)
    - Built-in error handling with SOAP Fault
    - Uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language) for service definition

!!! info "When to Use"

    - Enterprise integration requiring formal contracts, such as enterprise web services
    - Financial transactions and healthcare information exchange requiring security
    - Government systems integration and regulated industries
    - Legacy system integration with strict reliability requirements

### GraphQL

Query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the
data they need.

!!! tip "Advantages"

    - Single endpoint for all operations
    - Clients specify exactly what data they need
    - Strongly typed schema
    - Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data

!!! info "When to Use"

    - Applications with complex data requirements
    - Mobile apps needing to minimize bandwidth usage
    - APIs serving multiple client types with different needs
    - Rapidly evolving frontends with changing data requirements

!!! warning "Considerations"

    - More complex server implementation
    - Potential for performance issues with nested queries
    - Caching is more challenging than REST
    - Requires specialized tooling and client libraries

### gRPC

High-performance, open-source universal RPC framework using Protocol Buffers.

!!! info "Key Features"

    - Uses HTTP/2 for transport
    - Binary serialization with Protocol Buffers
    - Strongly typed contracts
    - Supports streaming: unary, server, client, and bidirectional

!!! info "When to Use"

    - Microservice communication requiring high performance
    - Real-time communication with bidirectional streaming
    - Polyglot environments (services written in different languages)
    - IoT systems with limited bandwidth
    - Low-latency, high-throughput communication

!!! warning "Limitations"

    - Limited browser support
    - Less human-readable than JSON
    - Requires Protocol Buffer compilation
    - Less suitable for public APIs

## API Implementation Considerations

### API Versioning

Strategies for evolving APIs while maintaining backward compatibility.

!!! example "Common Approaches"

    - **URL path versioning**: `/api/v1/resources`
    - **Query parameter**: `/api/resources?version=1`
    - **Header-based**: `Accept: application/vnd.company.v1+json`
    - **Content negotiation**: `Accept: application/json;version=1`

### API Documentation

Tools and formats for documenting APIs to improve developer experience.

!!! example "Standards & Tools"

    - **OpenAPI/Swagger**: REST API specification
    - **RAML**: RESTful API Modeling Language
    - **API Blueprint**: Markdown-based documentation
    - **GraphQL Schema**: Self-documenting type system
    - **WSDL**: Web Services Description Language for SOAP

## API Communication Mechanisms

API Communication Mechanisms define how clients and servers exchange information, covering both request-response patterns and event-driven approaches.

### Polling

Client regularly checks the server for new data at fixed intervals.

!!! warning "Considerations"

    - Simple but inefficient for real-time data; generates unnecessary requests

### Long Polling

Client makes a request to the server, and the server holds the connection open until new data is available.

!!! tip "Best For"

    - Simple real-time applications where WebSockets might be overkill

### Webhooks

Event-driven pattern where HTTP callbacks deliver data to other applications in real-time when specific events occur.

!!! info "Characteristics"

    - Push-based notification mechanism
    - Event-driven communication
    - HTTP POST requests with payload
    - Requires endpoint registration
    - Typically uses JSON or XML for payloads

!!! info "When to Use"

    - Real-time notifications
    - Integration with third-party services
    - Event-driven architectures
    - Systems requiring asynchronous processing

!!! example "Common Use Cases"

    - Payment processing notifications
    - Source control commit triggers
    - CRM data change events
    - IoT device state changes

### Circuit Breaker

Pattern that prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services.

!!! info "States"

    - **Closed**: Requests flow normally
    - **Open**: Requests immediately fail without attempting to call the service
    - **Half-Open**: Limited requests allowed to test if service has recovered

## API Reliability & Protection

### Rate Limiting

Strategy to restrict the number of API requests a user can make within a
specified time period.

!!! example "Common Approaches"

    - Fixed window
    - Sliding window
    - Token bucket
    - Leaky bucket

### Throttling

Mechanism to control the usage of APIs by limiting the rate at which consumers can make calls.

!!! tip "Implementation"

    - Should return 429 (Too Many Requests) status code with Retry-After header

### Idempotency

Property where multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single
request.

!!! example "HTTP Methods"

    - **Naturally idempotent**: GET, PUT, DELETE
    - **Not naturally idempotent**: POST (requires idempotency keys)

### Backoff Strategies

Technique where a client progressively increases the delay between retries after failed requests.

!!! example "Common Types"

    - **Exponential backoff**: Wait times increase exponentially (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
    - **Jittered backoff**: Adds randomness to avoid thundering herd problems
