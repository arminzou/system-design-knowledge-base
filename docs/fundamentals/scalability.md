# Scalability & Performance

## Scaling Strategies

### Vertical Scaling

Increasing the capacity of a single server by adding more resources (CPU, RAM).

!!! info "Pros and Cons"

    - **Pros**: Simple, no distribution complexity
    - **Cons**: Limited by hardware capacity, expensive at high end

### Horizontal Scaling

Adding more machines to a system to handle increased load, distributing
processing across multiple servers.

!!! info "Pros and Cons"

    - **Pros**: Linear cost scaling, high availability, fault tolerance
    - **Cons**: Increased complexity, data consistency challenges

## Performance Optimization

### Replication

Process of creating and maintaining duplicate copies of data across multiple
nodes.

!!! info "Types"

    - **Master-slave**: One primary write node, multiple read replicas
    - **Multi-master**: Multiple nodes accept writes
    - **Peer-to-peer**: All nodes are equal

### Caching

Temporary storage of copies of data to reduce retrieval time and server load.

!!! example "Caching Levels"

    - **Client-side**: Browser cache, mobile app cache
    - **CDN caching**: Edge locations
    - **Application caching**: In-memory caches like Redis
    - **Database caching**: Query cache, buffer pool

## Load Balancing

### Load Balancer Types

Different approaches to distributing traffic across servers.

!!! info "Common Types"

    - **Round Robin**: Distributes requests sequentially
    - **Least Connections**: Sends to server with fewest active connections
    - **IP Hash**: Routes based on client IP
    - **Weighted**: Assigns different weights to servers

### Load Balancer Features

Key capabilities of load balancers.

!!! tip "Important Features"

    - Health checking
    - SSL termination
    - Session persistence
    - Request routing
    - Traffic monitoring

## Performance Metrics

### Response Time

Time taken for a system to respond to a request.

!!! info "Components"

    - **Network latency**: Time for data to travel
    - **Processing time**: Time for server to process request
    - **Database time**: Time for database operations

### Throughput

Number of requests a system can handle per unit time.

!!! example "Measurement"

    - Requests per second (RPS)
    - Transactions per second (TPS)
    - Queries per second (QPS)

### Resource Utilization

How efficiently system resources are being used.

!!! warning "Key Metrics"

    - CPU usage
    - Memory usage
    - Disk I/O
    - Network bandwidth

## Scaling Patterns

### Sharding

Horizontal partitioning of data across multiple databases.

!!! info "Strategies"

    - **Range-based**: Partition by value ranges
    - **Hash-based**: Use hash function on key
    - **Directory-based**: Lookup table for shard location

### Partitioning

Dividing data into smaller, more manageable pieces.

!!! example "Types"

    - **Vertical**: Split by columns
    - **Horizontal**: Split by rows
    - **Functional**: Split by business function

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Database Optimization

Techniques to improve database performance.

!!! tip "Strategies"

    - Indexing
    - Query optimization
    - Connection pooling
    - Denormalization

### Application Optimization

Methods to enhance application performance.

!!! info "Approaches"

    - Code profiling
    - Memory management
    - Asynchronous processing
    - Batch processing
